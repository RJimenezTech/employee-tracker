  ## Installation
  
  Clone the github repository here. After installing dependencies and resetting MySQL credentials, you will need to seed the data. Through the MySQL CLI, by enter "mysql -u root -p" and enter your MySQL credentials. From the MySQL CLI, enter the following commands: "source db/db.sql" "source db/schema.sql" "source db/seeds.sql". Then enter "\q" to return to the terminal. The seed data should be initialized, so to run the application enter "node index.js" in the temrinal.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Checkout this YouTube demo for a quick walkthough: [DEMO](https://youtu.be/VsdAZ36OVqg).
  
  You will be prompted with a list of options to choose from, like "View All Departments" and "Add a Role." Information will be displayed on the CLI based on your selects, and additional information will be requested if you are updating the database in anyway. The application has seed data, so the user is welcome to update the seed data to meet your specific needs.
